### 👋 Hi there

👨🏻‍💻 I'm Mikhail Tetelev

🏡 I temporarily live in 🇬🇪 Kutaisi, `Georgia` (the country, not the state!),
previously lived in 🇷🇺 Russia, and I am thinking about relocating to 🇨🇭 Europe.

🐍 I am a `Python` developer (mostly Django) and have also dealt with
🟨 `JavaScript`. I like complicated algorithms of all kinds, but I usually move
JSON between the frontend and the database (🪚 the world is so cruel).

🌍 Here are a few small projects that are here:

- [image generator](https://github.com/tetelevm/random_image_generator) consisting of unique patterns
- [telegram bot](https://github.com/tetelevm/lorem_text_bot) for generating abstract pseudotext phrases
- [bot for controlling](https://github.com/tetelevm/bot_of_tower) the building of towers made of letters in telegram chats
- [interpreter of the](https://github.com/tetelevm/small_projects/tree/main/brainfuck) **brainfuck** language and a couple of dozen its translations
- [academic project](https://github.com/tetelevm/file_deployment_manager) with implementation of different optimization algorithms (a couple of algorithms are planned)
- [test project](https://github.com/tetelevm/fr_test_task) on **django**+**vue** to learn some new things (WIP)
