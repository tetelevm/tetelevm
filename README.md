### 👋 Hi there

👨🏻‍💻 I'm Mikhail Tetelev

🏡 I temporarily live in 🇬🇪 Kutaisi, `Georgia` (the country, not the state!), used
to live in 🇷🇺 Russia, and I am thinking about relocating to 🇨🇭 Europe.

🐍 I am a `Python` developer (mostly Django) and have also dealt with
🟨 `JavaScript`. I like complicated algorithms of all kinds, but I usually move
JSON between the frontend and the database (🪚 the world is so cruel).

🍯 To be honest, I haven't had too many years in development yet, so I can't
tell anything interesting about myself (but I'm actively fixing that).

🌟 Thought of, here's an interesting one: I like lobiani (it's the Georgian
🫘 bean-filled bread), and I recommend everyone to come to 🇬🇪 Georgia (still not
the state!) and taste it for themselves.

🌍 Here are a few small projects that are here:

- `lorem_text_bot`: telegram bot for generating abstract pseudotext phrases
- `random_image_generator`: image generator consisting of unique patterns
- `small_projects/brainfuck`: interpreter of the **brainfuck** language and a
	couple of dozen its translations

📧 You can contact me by mail `tetelevm@proton.me`
